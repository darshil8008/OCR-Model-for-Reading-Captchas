# OCR-Model-for-Reading-Captchas

Deep learning model for reading captchas.

This example demonstrates a simple OCR model built with the Functional API.  

Loaded the data from https://github.com/AakashKumarNain/CaptchaCracker/raw/master/captcha_images_v2.zip.  

Have used tensorflow and keras for creating the model.

Apart from combining CNN and RNN, it also illustrates how you can instantiate a new layer and use it as an "Endpoint layer" for implementing CTC loss.
